## This site was built using the following parameters:
Options `{markdown}`

* Document Root: `{DOC_ROOT}`
* Working Dir: `{working_dir}`
* Source Dir: `{source_dir}`

When writing structured pages, you can include a dynamically generated
table of contents anywhere on your pages by using the built-in local `TOC` macro.

Files named `index.md` will feature a dynamically generated list of other pages
in the same directory containing `<!-- date XXXX/XX/XX -->` metadata tags
appended to the bottom of this document, sorted by creation date.
